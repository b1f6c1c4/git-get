.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
git-gets uses git(1) to \fB(1)\fR download a repo and its submodules from a remote repo\&;
or \fB(2)\fR download submodules of an existing repo.
Only minimium amount of data will be transferred\&.
It cannot restrict itself to a single file or directory; use \fBgit-get\fR(1) if you only need a part of a repo.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
-V, --version
.RS 4
Show \fBgit-get\fR(1) version\&.
.RE
.PP
-h, --help
.RS 4

.RE

.RE
.PP
-q, --quiet
.RS 4
Suppress \fBgit-clone\fR(1) progress report\&.
.RE
.PP
--no-recursive
.RS 4
Only the top-level submodules will be downloaded, don't recurse down\&.
.RE
.PP
-o <target>, --output=<target>
.RS 4
Put the downloaded file or directory to <target>\&.
See \fB-F\fR options for overwrite policies\&.
Only valid in form \fB(1)\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
-F, --rm-rf
.RS 4
If <target> is an existing directory,
you may override the directory with \fB-F\fR\&.
Otherwise \fBgit-gets\fR(1) will fail\&.
Only valid in form \fB(1)\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
-x
.RS 4
Make the downloaded repository look as similar as one
created by an ordinary \fBgit clone\fR at the cost of a little bit
more network bandwidth and disk space.
This option implies that \fB.git\fR is NOT removed (see below), i.e. \fB--flat\fR is NOT used.
Specifically, using \fB-x\fR has the following effects:
.IP \[bu] 2
All commits will be downloaded: you can still view the full history
when doing a normal \fBgit log\fR.
.IP \[bu]
All trees and blobs will be lazy loaded: they won't be downloaded
until you explicitly checkout / switch / show it.
Thus, running \fBgit log -p\fR or \fBgit log --stat\fR WITHOUT ANY RESTRICTION
will trigger downloading the WHOLE REPOSITORY, an absolute disaster.
.IP \[bu]
\fBgit fetch\fR, \fBgit pull\fR, and \fBgit push\fR will behave (mostly) normal,
instead of mirroring by default.
To take a deeper look on this, please read the following reference:

.RE
.PP
--flat
.RS 4
Remove the whole git repository \fB.git\fR to save disk space\&.
Only valid in form \fB(1)\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
--tag-file=VERSION
.RS 4
Rename and relocate the tag file by specifying \fB--tag-file\fR (which implies \fB-t\fR\&.)
Tag file is a file, usually named VERSION, that is put along side with your downloaded file or inside your downloaded directory\&.
It records the SHA-1 of the commit you downloaded it from\&.
Without this file and without \fB.git\fR repo, others will lose track of where the code came from\&.
Only valid in form \fB(1)\fR and when \fB--flat\fR is specified.
.RE
.PP
-P, --parallel
.RS 4
Launch multiple instances of \fBgit-clone\fR(1) to speed things up.
.RE
.PP
-c, --confirm
.RS 4
Prompt the user before downloading a submodule\&.
.RE
.PP
--no-init
.RS 4
Do not call \fBgit-submodule init\fR so that only the submodules that have already been inited will be downloaded\&.
All second-level submodules will, however, still be inited and downloaded unless you specified \fB--no-recursive\fR\&.
Only valid in form \fB(2)\fR\&.
.RE
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
Download a repo and submodules:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
Method 1: Paste the original URL into the terminal:
$ git gets https://github.com/b1f6c1c4/git-get
Method 2: Type a few words in the terminal:
$ git gets b1f6c1c4/git-get
.sp
If you want it to be even faster:
$ git gets -P ...
.sp
If you want to make changes and push back:
$ git gets -x ...
.sp
If you want to save disk space:
$ git gets --flat ...
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.RE
.PP
You already have a repo, and you want its submodules:
(Usually you will need \fB-x\R, but that's not required)
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ git gets -x           # Just give me all
$ git gets -x -c        # Let me choose
$ git gets -x --no-init # Only those with 'git submodule init ...'
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.RE
.SH "VARIABLES"
.PP
GH_USE_HTTPS
.RS 4
When called in the minimalistic <user>/<repo> form,
clone from https://github.com instead of git@github.com\&.
Helpful if there isn't an SSH key.
